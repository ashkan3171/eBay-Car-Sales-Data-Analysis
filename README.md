   - Renaming and reorganizing columns for better readability.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Investigating patterns and trends in the dataset.
   - Visualizing data using various Python libraries.

3. **Key Insights:**
   - Analysis of price distributions.
   - Popular car brands and models.
   - Factors influencing car prices.
